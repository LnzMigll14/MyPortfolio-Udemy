<h1>The Best Movies According to Lanz</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>No Country For Old Men</h3>
<p>This movie is intense and worth to watch</p>
<h3>Sicario</h3>
<p>
  Another crime thriller movie Directed by Dennis Villenueve is one of my
  favorites. Dark and realistic and the ending part is the most intense and
  satisfying!
</p>
<h3>Logan</h3>
<p>
  A superhero movie based on Marvel comic book character Wolverine is one of the
  best X-Men films ever made.
